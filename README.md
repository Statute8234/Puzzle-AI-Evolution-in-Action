# Puzzle-AI-Evolution-in-Action

The code is a Python program using the Pygame library to create a puzzle game where enemies collect colored foods to gain points. It uses the NEAT algorithm to control the game's behavior. The code initializes the Pygame environment, sets up the game window, and defines classes for text, food, and enemy objects. It also implements the algorithm.

# About

This Python program uses the Pygame library to create a puzzle game where enemies collect colored foods, earning points based on their color. The game is controlled by a neural network trained using the NEAT algorithm. The code initializes the Pygame environment, sets up the game window, and defines colors and text rendering. It creates classes for text, food, and enemy objects, defines logic functions for adding food, handling collisions, and updating the game state. It also implements the NEAT algorithm for evolving neural networks and defines functions for evaluating genomes and running the NEAT algorithm.

# Features

The Python program for a puzzle game includes initializing the environment, setting up the main display window, defining color and text rendering, class definitions, game logic functions, adding food, handling collisions, updating game state, and implementing the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. The game uses the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural networks controlling enemies, and the game's performance is assessed through genome evaluation. The NEAT execution runs the algorithm to train and improve the neural networks based on their performance. This structure provides a solid foundation for the game, where the challenge comes from the evolving intelligence of enemy characters. The use of NEAT allows for dynamic learning and adaptation, potentially increasing the game's difficulty as the neural networks become more efficient at collecting food. This creative way to combine game development with machine learning is a creative way to combine game development with machine learning.

# Rating

The code is well-structured and organized, using object-oriented programming principles and encapsulation. However, it could benefit from more descriptive variable names and adding comments to clarify the purpose of sections or functions. Despite these improvements, it is a solid implementation of a game using Pygame and NEAT.
